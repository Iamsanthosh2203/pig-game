      <p class="text-2xl">Here are the basic rules of the Pig Game:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a six-sided die until either a 1
          is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
        </li>
        <li>
          If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing for that turn, and it
          becomes the next player's turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the player rolls any other number (2-6), the number is added to
          their turn total and they can choose to roll again or hold.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their
          overall score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          The game continues until one player reaches the target score (e.g.,
          100 points) and is declared the winner.
        </li>
